Our e-commerce web application seeks to connect health professionals to reduce the $1.1 billion annual waste of medical products in France and help hospital cure more patients by enabling them to purchase and sell medicine that expires in a few months, which is otherwise thrown away because they cannot be sold to individuals. 

Our application enables two types of users to sign up: pharmacies to sell medical products and hospitals to buy the medicine.
